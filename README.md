# GlassBreakers_DB
CS 3200 repo for final project. Includes database, appsmith UI, flask rest API

The app we have created is a platform for employees and HR managers to view and post job listings. This allows employees to view current job listings 
to analyze things like which location is best for their desired job or what the market value is for their desired job. It also allows HR managers to 
create a profile for their company, post new job listings, determine what salary new job listings should have, etc. 

This application is supported through a backend SQL database with data on employees, companies, job positions, reviews, etc. The routes that support 
querying the database are in a Flask rest API. It runs in a Docker instance and connects to AppSmith via ngrok.
